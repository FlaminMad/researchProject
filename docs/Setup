# Masters Research Project
Level Control Research Project Repo

There are 4 different tools that can be untilised within this project. Each
has its own setup instructions as described below.


# Data Logging Tool
This tool has been built upon the modbus protocol to allow the logging of data
at a set interval. Data is stored within an Excel file to make analysis of
results easier.

Ensure:
1. The port settings stored within Mobus.py are correct to match your
   configuration.
2. The 'dataLogging.xlsx file' is in the path directory. (If it is not, copy 
   'dataLoggingTemplate.xlsx' from /docs to the destinantion folder and rename)
3. The headers are correct for your configuration within xlsLogging.py.

The file, dataLoggingTool can then be run. To exit the program, use ctrl+c.
